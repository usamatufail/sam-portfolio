    title: 'Node.js Accelerator Program',
    description: `Attending Node.js Accelerator Program on Toptal was a fantastic experience for me. I had been interested in learning about node.js for a while, but had never had the chance to really dive into it. The accelerator program provided a structured and intensive learning environment that allowed me to quickly get up to speed with the basics of node.js, express.js, mongodb, mongoose, nest.js and start building real projects.\n\nOne of the things I appreciated most about the program was the focus on hands-on learning. We spent a lot of time working on exercises and building our own projects (I build two microservices one using express.js and another one using nest.js), which gave me the opportunity to apply what I was learning and see how it all fit together. The instructors were also very knowledgeable and were always willing to help out when I had questions or ran into issues.\n\nOverall, the node.js accelerator program was a great way for me to learn a new technology and start building my own projects. I feel much more confident in my ability to use node.js and related technologies now and am excited to continue learning and exploring its capabilities.`,

    title: 'Graduated with Computer Science Degree',
    description: `Graduating with a computer science degree was a challenging but rewarding experience for me. Throughout my studies, I had the opportunity to learn about a wide range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, computer architecture, and software engineering. I also had the chance to work on various projects and gain practical experience by applying what I had learned in the classroom.\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of my degree was balancing my coursework with other commitments. As a full-time student, I had to juggle my studies with part-time work and other responsibilities. This required a lot of time management and organization, but it was worth it in the end.\n\nOverall, I am proud of what I accomplished during my computer science degree. It was a lot of hard work, but I feel like I have a strong foundation in computer science and am well-prepared for my career. I am grateful for the knowledge and skills that I gained during my studies and am excited to see where my degree takes me in the future.`,
